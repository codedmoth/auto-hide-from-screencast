# Auto-Hide from Screencast
a little KDE script to enable the "Hide from Screencast" checkbox based on three conditions until they make it a Window Rule (if they ever do.. LOL)

Config options:
 - Hide on Launch = Hides when a window with a matching class opens
 - Hide on Focus = ^ and whenever a window is focused
 - Hide Always = Hides when a window is opened, focused, OR the "Hide from Screencast" option is toggled off.

Config example: discord,1password,zen

(note that the examples IN config.ui have spaces - I have not tested this.)

I currently use `kpackagetool6 --type=KWin/Script -i ./src` to install the script. (you can also use install.sh, OR uninstall.sh to remove if you'd like to do it that way, there IS a button in the menu soo ... /shrug)

I don't know the first thing on how to put this on the KDE Store so ... yeah.



config.ui is mostly generated by AI (deepseek ... ????). I did originally make a .ui file but it didn't work /shrug. not entirely sure what I did wrong.
main.xml is partially if not at all generated by AI, main.js is the same. I don't know Javascript very much, sorry.
